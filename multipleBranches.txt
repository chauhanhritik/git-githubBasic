checking out(making) a new branch from master--
git branch branch2  // makes a new branch by the name of branch2
git checkout branch2 //changes the current working branch to branch2


git branch --> shows available branches

//to combine branch2 into main branch, we first checkout to master branch and then use the command-
git merge branch2
